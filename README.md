### PURPOSE.

The aim of this project is extending a MOMA´s artists database taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/momanyc/museum-collection) with some interesting insights of the education and economy from the countries they are from. Naturally, this work is just an approach to the artists´s instruction and economic environment but does not want to draw any firm conclusion of it; many other facts should have been taken into account.

### PROCEDURE.

I have imported a database from kaggle referred to the art&artists that have exhibited their work in MOMA. To get a better outline, I have decided to focus on the artists that have have exposed in the last 50 years.

After having cleaned and transformed the csv I have introduced some data using "BeautifulSoup" scrapping from following websites;

[Chartsbin](http://chartsbin.com/view/41109) that shows the creativity index by country.

[Country economy](https://countryeconomy.com/gdp?year=1980) that shows the GDP by country.

According to the data it seems to be more correlation with economic growth than with creativity index education. Anyway, as mentioned before, this is just a sketch and it should be kept in mind other aspects like cultural affinity or political interests.
